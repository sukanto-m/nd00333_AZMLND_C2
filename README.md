# Operationalizing Machine Learning

In this project we use the Bank Marketing dataset to train machine learning models on AzureML for a classification task. Two approaches are used to operationalize: one is an AutoML run and the other is a pipeline run. The model with the highest accuracy rate is deployed as an endpoint as an Azure Container Instance (ACI). Through the ACI, the REST endpoint with authentication is used to access the model via API documentation enabled by Swagger.

## Architectural Diagram
*TODO*: Provide an architectual diagram of the project and give an introduction of each step.

## Key Steps
*TODO*: Write a short discription of the key steps. Remeber to include all the screencasts required to demonstrate key steps. 

*TODO* Remeber to provide screenshots of the `RunDetails` widget as well as a screenshot of the best model trained with it's parameters.

## Screen Recording
*TODO* Provide a link to a screen recording of the project in action. Remember that the screencast should demonstrate:

## Standout Suggestions
*TODO (Optional):* This is where you can provide information about any standout suggestions that you have attempted.
